repo for `thegangfightsgod.xyz`

A project by Gabriella Agathon [@Contrastellar](https://twitter.com/contrastellar) to help my friends with raiding but not in raids. This site is supposed to serve as a wiki for things such as loot, loot rules, tomestones, and other aspects of raiding that isn't exactly mechanics. Although this may also serve as a source of information regarding things like (static strats), pf strats, and other fun things.

This is a WIP, and should not be considered a "finished product" until otherwise notated in this `README`, where a commit hash is noted as being a full-release version.
